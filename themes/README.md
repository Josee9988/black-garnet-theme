# **themes folder**

A folder with the theme.

## **themes/Black Garnet-color-theme.json**

* File with the readable theme, this file will not be interpreted by VSCode to use the theme.
* When the user installs the extension from the marketplace this file will not be downloaded but will help any developer to check the theme settings.

## **themes/Black Garnet-color-theme-min.json**

* File with the code that the theme is using and VSCode will interpret, but it is minified so the file will take less room in your hard drive and will perform a little bit better.
